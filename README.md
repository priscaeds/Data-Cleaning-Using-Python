 . Handle missing values

 . Remove duplicates

 . Perform data normalization

 # Tools Used
 Python
 
 Pandas library
 
 NumPy library

 # Key Insights
 Some percentage of the data was missing and others were duplicate. This can affect analysis accuracy but the
 cleaning process:
 
 . Reduced errors and improved the reliability of analysis
 
 . Reduced data redundancy and improved model performance
 
 . Improved the data quality.
